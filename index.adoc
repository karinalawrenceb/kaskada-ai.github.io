## Kaskada is a query engine for event-based data designed to solve the unique challenges of building & operating real-time ML at scale. 

Kaskada unifies historical and real-time data processing, allowing practitioners to instantly reconstruct the historical results of a query and then deploy the same query as a live materialization without losing historical context.

Kaskadaâ€™s unique capabilities are the result of its time-aware query abstractions, a high-performance compute engine, and a configurable execution model supporting bulk and real-time data processing.


----
== Train models

====
.Native Time Travel
Revisit the result of any query at any point in time.
Use the same query languge to define what to compute and to when to compute it.
====

====
.Instant exploration
Efficiently compute directly from raw events.
Safely downsample results with input slicing.
====

====
.Temporal joins
Point-in-time operations between results with different groupings.
Combine results defined at different times as continuous values.
====
----

----
== Deploy models

====
.Unified queries
Execute the same query in batch mode over historical data or in incremental mode over real-time streams.
====

====
.It's fast
Compute engine implemented in Rust for performance and safety.
Computation is built on Apache Arrow for speedy CPU utilization.
====

====
.Real-time with history
Transparently bootstrap real-time queries with the full history of raw events.
