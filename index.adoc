## Kaskada is a query engine for event-based data designed to solve the unique challenges of building & operating real-time ML at scale. 

Kaskada unifies historical and real-time data processing, allowing practitioners to instantly reconstruct the historical results of a query and then deploy the same query as a live materialization without losing historical context.

Kaskadaâ€™s unique capabilities are the result of its time-aware query abstractions, a high-performance compute engine, and a configurable execution model supporting bulk and real-time data processing.


### Train models
* Data-dependent, entity-specific time-travel
* Instant, self-service exploration
* Point-in-time joins & lookups


### Deploy models
* Unified historical & real-time queries
* High-performance engine
* Model performance / drift metrics
